# Examples

**kima** provides several examples showing the analysis of standard datasets and some best practices. 
Each example is implemented as a function which creates, and optionally runs, a given model.
They can all be accessed through the `examples` module

```py
from kima import examples
```

or directly

```py
from kima.examples import multi_instrument
```

The following pages describe each example in some depth:

- [_51Peg](51Peg) (note the `_` here, so the function can be a valid Python name)
- [multi_instrument](multi_instrument)
- [transiting_planet](transiting_planet)
- [Circumbinary planet using the BINARIESmodel](TIC172900988)
- [Gaia BH3](GaiaBH3)
