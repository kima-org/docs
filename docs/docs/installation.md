# Installation

Both **kima** and `pykima` can easily be installed using pip:


```sh
pip install kima
```

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/kima.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/kima)

Alternatively, you can also clone the :material-github: GitHub repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/j-faria/kima.git
```

and install the package locally

```sh
cd kima
make -j 4
pip install -e .
```


!!! note  
    You may choose to analyse the results without `pykima` since the inputs and
    outputs of **kima** itself are simple text files. `pykima` will just make it
    a bit easier.
 
 
 If the installation fails, take a look at the
 [troubleshooting](https://github.com/j-faria/kima/wiki/Troubleshooting){:target="_blank"}
 section of the wiki or [open an
