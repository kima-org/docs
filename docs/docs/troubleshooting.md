### Problems with installation

- We've pre-packaged **kima** so that it can be easily installed with `pip`. If
  the installation fails on your machine, it could be because you're using an
  old version of a C++ compiler. Try running `g++ --version` to check the
  version (or the appropriate command for the compiler you're using).

- If you can't get it to work, [open an issue](https://github.com/kima-org/kima/issues) 
  on GitHub and let's try to fix it.


### Other issues

- Segmentation faults  
  If you run into a segmentation fault before **kima** even prints anything to
  the terminal, it might be due to an issue reading the data files. Check if the
  first three columns of the file(s) are numbers and not strings.
  

### I think something is wrong...

Let us know in the [issues](https://github.com/kima-org/kima/issues) if you think
there is a problem or if something doesn't work as expected.


### I could do with some help analysing RVs

**kima** is free software and provided *as is* within the terms of the
[LICENSE](https://github.com/kima-org/kima/blob/master/LICENSE). However, we are
available to help if we can! The [issue
tracker](https://github.com/kima-org/kima/issues) is a good place to ask
questions about **kima** or the analysis of RV data, but feel free to contact us
by email if needed.
